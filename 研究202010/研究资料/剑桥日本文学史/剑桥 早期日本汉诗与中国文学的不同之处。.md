90-91:

Despite a strongly emulative relation to Chinese poetry, Japanese poets adapted the medium to their own needs. They coined expressions that are not attested in contemporary Chinese sources. The distinctive connections between the court, reclusion, the world of immortals, and romantic love in early Sino-Japanese anthologies are still little explored. If Chinese boudoir laments were usually written by male poets in the female voice, in early Japan, where vernacular poetry allowed communication between the sexes, a man could write a “boudoir lament” about himself (Kaifu ¯so ¯ 118) and a woman could write one for herself (Bunka shu ¯reishu ¯ 50, 55).

日本诗人将汉诗是做媒介。他们利用这种媒介作出了有别于中国诗歌传统的表达。关于朝廷、隐逸、非道德的世界以及浪漫爱情之间的联系到现在为止还很少被发现。如果中国的闺怨诗是男性诗人以女性的声音表达的媒介，那么在早期日本，世俗诗允许性的交流，一个男性诗人能够书写关于自己的闺怨情怀。
