88:

If anything, Kaifu ¯so ¯ has been the Man’yo ¯shu ¯’s neglected twin, disparaged as a novice collection; its historical value is conceded but its literary worth denigrated, and what in Man’yo ¯shu ¯ appears primeval and vigorous is considered primitive and imitative in Kaifu ¯so ¯. Most scholars criticize its egregious disregard for the tonal rules of Chinese “regulated poetry,” rather than appreciating the poets’ passionate practice of parallel couplets; or they detect cases of “plagiarism” rather than understanding the lifting of lines from Chinese “originals” as in principle little different from the extensive borrowing of Chinese diction that characterizes early Sino-Japanese literature as a whole.

怀风藻的历史价值被确认了，但是其文学性却一直被低估。事实上，万叶集中很多原始的、激情的表现都被认为源自或是对怀风藻的模仿。大多数的学者认为，怀风藻并没有严格遵循中国律诗的格律，但是他们并没有关注到怀风藻中诗人对于对句、平行结构的热情实践。又或者，他们仅仅将怀风藻视作一种抄袭，而不是将其中与中国orginals有关的诗作看成原则上与广泛的borrowing中国diction有着微妙的差别，这种borrowing将早期日中文学成为了一个整体。

【Plagiarism和borrowing的区别：

Plagiarism：the act of using another person's words or ideas without giving credit to that person : the act of plagiarizing something。未经允许，使用了其他人的词汇表达或想法。

Borrow： to take and use (something that belongs to someone else) for a period of time before returning it；to take and use up (something) with the promise to give back something of equal value。拿是拿了，但是有return something的愿望。to use (an idea, saying, etc.) that was thought up by someone else。】
